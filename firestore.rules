/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing a strict owner-only access model for user data
 * and restricting write access to the gallery. Read access to the gallery is public.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles.
 * - /vehicles/{vehicleId}: Stores vehicle information (make, model, etc.). Write access is denied.
 * - /gallery/{galleryItemId}: Stores gallery images with captions. Write access is denied.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly private; only the owner can read or write it.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - The gallery collection is read-only from the client; all writes are denied.
