/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset implements a basic security model.
 *  - User profiles are secured with owner-only access.
 *  - The vehicle and gallery collections are publicly readable, but only authenticated users can write to them.
 * @data_structure
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 *  - /vehicles/{vehicleId}: Stores vehicle data.
 *  - /gallery/{galleryItemId}: Stores gallery items.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - Users can only access their own profile data.
 *  - Vehicle and gallery listing is public.
 *  - Data shape is not strictly enforced in this prototype.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *  - None.
 * @structural_segregation
 *  - None.
